Exoplanet Exploration Game
Purpose

This game was created as both an experiment in Human–AI interaction and an immersive exploration experience. The goal is not only to entertain but also to explore how humans and autonomous agents can collaborate in complex, uncertain environments. By placing the player in the role of a mission supervisor, the game invites reflection on trust, communication, and autonomy—concepts at the core of human–autonomy teaming research.

Story

You are leading a pioneering mission on a distant exoplanet. After landing a module on alien soil, you deploy a swarm of robots to map the terrain, gather resources, and search for traces of an enigmatic monolith—an object that may hold answers about the planet’s origins, or perhaps something far greater.
Communication with Earth is limited, and your robots rely on you to balance strategy, resource management, and risk. The exoplanet is as hostile as it is mysterious, and success will depend on how effectively you coordinate your robotic team.

Gameplay Overview

Command a swarm of robots: flying scouts and rolling explorers, each with unique strengths and weaknesses.

Balance autonomy and control: you can give high-level orders, but robots may need to adapt—or fail—when beyond your communication range.

Explore and survive: manage energy and resources to ensure your robots can continue their mission.

Discover the unknown: gradually unveil the map, locate the monolith, and uncover the planet’s hidden anomalies.

Rather than focusing on fast-paced combat, the gameplay emphasizes strategic decision-making, exploration under uncertainty, and the subtle dynamics of human–machine collaboration.

Development Status

This game is still in active development. Some features may be incomplete or unstable. Feedback and contributions are welcome as the project evolves.
