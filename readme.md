# Exoplanet Explorer  
**An Open Educational Game for Teaching Human–Autonomy Teaming (HAT)**

---

## Overview

**Exoplanet Explorer** is an open-source educational video game designed to support the teaching and study of **Human–Autonomy Teaming (HAT)**.

The game provides a dynamic collaboration environment in which a human player supervises and coordinates a team of autonomous robotic agents operating in a planetary exploration mission.

Unlike traditional case-based teaching materials, Exoplanet Explorer allows learners to *interact directly* with autonomy, making task interdependencies, coordination breakdowns, and interface transparency issues experientially observable.

The platform serves two complementary purposes:

1. **Pedagogical tool** for teaching Interdependence Analysis  
2. **Lightweight research testbed** for studying human–autonomy interaction  

---

## Educational Objectives

The game is explicitly designed to support instruction in:

- Coactive Design, especially Interdependence Analysis (IA)
- Task allocation modeling
- Human–autonomy coordination constraints
- Shared Interface ergonomic design in HAT systems

Typical instructional use includes asking students to:

- Model task allocation between human and robots  
- Identify unmet coordination requirements  
- Propose interface improvements grounded in HAT principles  
- Reflect on autonomy vs. automation distinctions

## Narrative Context

You are leading a pioneering mission from a control room on earth to a distant exoplanet.

After deploying a landing module, you supervise a swarm of heterogeneous robots tasked with:

- Mapping unknown terrain  
- Gathering resources  
- Detecting environmental anomalies  
- Searching for traces of a mysterious monolith  

Communication constraints, limited resources, and environmental uncertainty create coordination challenges that must be resolved through effective human–autonomy collaboration.
