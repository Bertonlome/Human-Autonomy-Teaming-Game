Exoplanet Exploration Game
Context:

You play as the supervisor of an exploration mission on an unknown exoplanet, leading a swarm of robots deployed from a landing module. Your goal is to find and analyze a mysterious monolith that is located somewhere on the map. To do this, you will need to map the terrain and collect resources.
Starting Mechanics:
Landing Module:

The game starts with the landing of a central module (the base), which deploys a relay antenna that allows communication with Earth and the robots.
Robot Deployment:

Four robots can be deployed around the module. Each robot has its own capabilities for detection, movement, and exploration.
Antenna Coverage:

The visible area on the map depends on the position of the relay antenna and the robots. The field of vision is limited to:

    10 units around the base.
    6 units around each flying drone (UAV).
    4 units around each rolling drone (UGV).

Game Objectives:
Explore the Map:

Clear the fog of war by deploying the robots to explore the surroundings of the antenna and beyond.
Find the Monolith:

Search for the monolith’s location. To assist you, the robots are equipped with sensors that allow them to assess the gravitational anomaly around their location. According to research, the monolith creates a significant anomaly in its vicinity.
Communication and Movement Rules:
Limited Communication:

Robots can only receive instructions if they are within coverage range:

    Within the base antenna’s range.
    Within another robot’s range, as long as it’s within antenna range.

Robot Autonomy Outside Coverage:

If a robot goes out of range, it will no longer respond to commands.
Exploration Mechanics:
Manual or Autonomous Control:

You can manually control each robot using the direction keys (WASD/ZQSD) or let them explore autonomously (randomly).

    The flying robot can hover over most terrain.
    The rolling robot can only traverse non-rough terrain.

The rolling robot may get stuck after a maneuver. To free it, another robot must position itself next to it to extract it.
Dynamic Vision:

The map is revealed as the robots move. They are equipped with cameras that can detect elements in the environment.

    The game camera can follow the selected robot using the button in the UI.
    The game camera can be moved using the arrow keys when it's not "tracking" a robot.

Energy Management:

    Energy Consumption: Each movement of the robots consumes energy. You must manage resources so that the robots can return to the module to recharge before their batteries run out.

Human-Machine Interaction:

The goal is to figure out how to use the 4 robots to successfully complete the mission. The flying robots are fast for reconnaissance, while the rolling robots are slow but capable of performing analysis on the monolith.

The options menu allows you to adjust the volume of music and SFX, as well as toggle between windowed and full-screen modes. PLEASE NOTE that the game is under development, and some features may not function correctly or the game may freeze. If this happens, exit the level using the escape key, then restart the level. If problems persist, quit and restart the game.
