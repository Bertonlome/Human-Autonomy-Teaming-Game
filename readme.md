Exoplanet Exploration Game
Purpose

This game was created as a pedagogical tool for teaching Human–AI Teaming. The goal is to provide a support to learners in HAT and also to provide a testbed for HAT studies in complex, uncertain environments. By placing the player in the role of a mission supervisor, the game invites reflection on task allocation patterns, interdependence, teaming requirements and other concepts at the core of HAT research.

**Story**
You are leading a pioneering mission on a distant exoplanet. After landing a module on alien soil, you deploy a swarm of robots to map the terrain, gather resources, and search for traces of an enigmatic monolith.
Communication with Earth is limited, and your robots rely on you to balance strategy, resource management, and risk. The exoplanet is an uncertain environment, and success will depend on how effectively you coordinate your team.

**Gameplay Overview**
Command a swarm of robots: flying drones and rolling rovers, each with unique strengths and weaknesses.
Balance autonomy and control: you can give high-level orders, but robots may need to adapt or fail, or you can choose low-level systematic oversight but at the cost of time and flexibility.
Explore and survive: manage energy and resources to ensure your robots can continue their mission.
Discover the planer: gradually unveil the map, locate the monolith, and uncover the planet’s hidden anomalies.

**Development Status**
This game is still in active development. Some features may be incomplete or unstable. Feedback and contributions are welcome as the project evolves.
